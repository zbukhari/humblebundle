Humble Bundle scripts

Simple python script to make going through Humble Bundle sales easier.

In order to look through it all run hb-sales.py then there will be an html file therein, open that up and you should be good.

Enjoy - let me know if there are any issues and or suggestions.

This is using:

FontAwesome
Bootstrap
Bootstrap-table

Updated for Python3.
Standard except Using BeautifulSoup 4.

Changed a lot of stuff.

* Reworked caching to actually be more efficient
* Using HumbleBundle Icons now
* Changed how platforms and delivery methods are organized. Kind of like HB as well.
* Marking handheld friendly apps. Thanks in large part to Steam for their Steam Deck. Everything else was fun and stuff but the Steam Deck kicked it up a notch. Obviously thanks to Nintendo for the WiiU. Remember, Every failure is a lesson learned. WiiU - commercial flop, but LITERALLY the foundation for the Switch. The Switch, the foundation for everything else afterwards :-) TLDR - if you failed, congratulations, you're one step closer to success!

Todo:

* Rework table row instead of just text. Should be a short hop but this took a lot of effort.
* Learn more JS ... everytime I do something new and fandangled I find out that it's a crappier version of something old... and ppl say that old ppl are scared of new things, ya'll ever heard of a foreach loop not being allowed to use continue?! C'mon! :-D j/k - THE CHILDREN/YOUTH/YOUNG'UNS ARE THE FUTURE!
