Simple python script to make going through Humble Bundle sales easier.

In order to look through it all run hb-sales.py then there will be an html file therein, open that up and you should be good.

Enjoy - let me know if there are any issues and or suggestions.

This is using:

Most all other items are using standard python libraries.
